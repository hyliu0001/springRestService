/*
@SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:
@Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
@EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. Technically, Spring Boot doesnâ€™t have anything to auto-configure when it comes to scheduling but a future version might.
@ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the the hello package, allowing it to find the ScheduledTasks.
